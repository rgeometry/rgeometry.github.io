    h3 Fixed precision vs arbitrary precision
    p
      | While research often assumes infinite precision, RGeometry supports both arbitrary and fixed-precision modes.
      | We avoid precision loss through exact geometric primitivesâ€”for example, comparing distances without computing them.
    p
      | All algorithms are tested with 8bit, 16bit, 32bit, and 64bit integers, plus 32bit and 64bit floating-point.

    h3 Property testing
    p
      | RGeometry uses comprehensive property testing to ensure correctness. We generate diverse test data including
      | convex polygons, monotone polygons, star-shaped polygons, and two-opt polygons across multiple precision levels.
    p
      | All documented API properties are verified through automated testing. Additionally, efficient algorithms are validated
      | against slower but provably correct reference implementations.

    h3 Floating-point
    p
      | Fixed-precision floating-point arithmetic is notoriously difficult to get right but widely used in practice.
      | The value space is enormous, making edge cases nearly impossible to discover through random sampling alone.
      | RGeometry addresses this by testing algorithms in 8-bit integer space, where the smaller value space
      | makes edge cases much easier to trigger and verify.
